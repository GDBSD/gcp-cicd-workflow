# Each step specified in the cloudbuild.yaml is a separate, ephemeral run of a docker image.artifacts:
# As an aid to someone unfamiliar with Docker just about every element in this file
# is documented.

# Syntax comments:
#   "entrypoint" configures a container that will run as an executable.
#  "/bin/bash" In an Ubuntu command used to link to bash.artifacts:
#  The "-c" bin/bash argument overrides the rest of the command line from that point on,
      # so that it's no longer going through bash's option handling.artifacts:
#  The "-m" Python argument is the module name. Python searches sys.path for the named module and execute its contents
     # as the __main__ module

steps:

  # Step 0 - Create the environment and the project folder
- name: 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/python-cloudbuild'
  entrypoint: '/bin/bash'
  args:
    [
      '-c',
      'python3 -m venv /gcp_cicd'
#      'python3 -m os.mkdir(workspace/gcp_cicd_workflow'
    ]

  # Step 1 - Create the persistent column
- name: 'ubuntu'
  volumes:
  - name: 'gcp_cicd_workflow'
    path: '/persistent_volume'
  entrypoint: 'bash'
  args:
  - '-c'
  - |
        echo "New volume" > /persistent_volume/file

- name: 'ubuntu'
  volumes:
  - name: 'gcp_cicd_workflow'
    path: '/persistent_volume'
  entrypoint: 'bash'
  args:
  - '-c'
  - |
        echo "Have the wew volume" > /persistent_volume/file


#  # Step 1 - Clone the GitHub repo
#- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/git'
#  args:
#    [
#      'clone',
#      '--recurse-submodules',
#      'https://github.com/GDBSD/gcp-cicd-workflow'
#    ]
#
#  # Step 2 - Checkout the branch we just pushed
#  # Variable $COMMIT_SHA provided by the Cloud Build so we test the correct commit.
#  # I need to save this
#- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/git'
#  args:
#    [
#      'checkout',
#      '$COMMIT_SHA'
#    ]
#  dir: 'gcp-cicd-workflow'
#
#  # Step 3 - Install the dependencies
#  # Installs any dependencies listed in the project's requirements.txt.
#- name: 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/python-cloudbuild'
#  entrypoint: 'gcp_cicd/bin/pip'
#  args:
#    [
#      'install',
#      '-V',
#      '-r',
#      'requirements.txt'
#    ]

#  # Step 4
#  # Runs pytest from the virtual environment (with all requirements)
#  # using the verbose flag so you can see each individual test.
#- name: 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/python-cloudbuild'
#  entrypoint: '/bin/bash/workspace/'
#  args: ['-m', 'pytest', '-v']
