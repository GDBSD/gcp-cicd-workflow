"from flask import Flask"  creates an object which refers to the entirety of the app itself. 
When we state "app = Flask(__name__)", we are creating the variable app which represents our 
application. Therefore, when we configure the variable app, weâ€™re configuring the way our entire 
application works.

To run the app, from the command line:
export FLASK_APP=flask_app.py
flask run

from flask import Flask
